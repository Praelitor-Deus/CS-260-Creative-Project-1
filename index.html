    <li>Hello! I'm Savvy and I'm a new D&D player
      (literally joining this club on September 25th, 2021 and never playing
      before) I'm looking for a D&D campaign to join while I'm Learning or is that
      not how it works? I don't know please correct me if wrong but I'm a bit
      lost on what to do now :), I love to roleplay, I love putting time and
      energy into making characters and stories, I'm a Minor though, Have a
      nice day  :)</li>

    <li>Have you ever wanted to know some of Ness's best combos but didn't
      know where to start? Tried to pick him up but couldn't get past PK
      Fire? Or just looking to play around with him as a different character?
      This article can provide you with some of my favorite combos from the
      PSI Wonder himself! Read it to learn more.
    </li>

    <li>So we all Black Lotus is both a power nine and on the reserved list and it's like
      $100,000 or so, but my question is IF it printed in a MEANINGFUL way like
      for example printing in a standard set today and not a special set like
      Modern Master or the like how expensive would actually be? Would it get
      cheaper, stay the same? My PERSONAL thoughts are that the Alpha would
      still fetch the 100 grand, But the newly printed one would run as...</li>

    <li>      So, I am asking: Do you find 5E combat fun? I allowed for
      four possible answers. I know some folks are absolutists, thus the raw
      yes/no responses - but understanding that even fun things can sometimes
      be unfun and unfun things occasionally turn out to be fun in certain
      circumstances, the "generally yes / generally no" responses is what I
      am most interested in. Yes it can depend on the DM, the specific scenario,
      the other players at the table, but generally. . .?</li>
