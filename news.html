    <h2>Stormlight Archive Book 5 Release Date, Title, Theories, Predictions, Speculation, Main Character, News and Everything You Need To Know about the Brandon Sanderson Book</h2>
    <p>The Stormlight Archive by Brandon Sanderson is a fantasy novel series of epic proportions,
        planned to have 10 books in total by the time of its completion. Presently, there are four
        books in the series: 'The Way of Kings (2010)', 'Words of Radiance (2014)', 'Oathbringer (2017)',
        and the recently published 'Rhythm of War (2020)'. The series takes place on the planet of Roshar
        - also the name of the continent where the story unfolds – a world with three moons and a large
        number of fantasy races, human and nonhuman. The series has been praised for its luscious world-building,
        characterization, and plot and the books have scored pretty high as New York Time bestsellers. But what about Book 5
        of the series? With the newest addition Rhythm of War only having come out in 2020, little has been
        revealed about Sanderson's next book. Here's what we know so far:   </p>

    <h2>EXPANDING DUNGEONS & DRAGONS</h2>
    <p>In North America, Dungeons & Dragons is more popular than ever, having racked up seven years
        of continuous growth since the launch of the game’s fifth edition in 2014. It’s now time to
        duplicate this success outside of North America, creating a truly global D&D community and
        getting us considerably closer to making the world’s greatest roleplaying game available to
        everyone across the globe. Today it is my pleasure to give you some of the first details of
        what we’re doing to make that happen.

        Earlier this year, Wizards of the Coast resumed direct control over localized versions of
        D&D in French, Italian, German, and Spanish, and started planning new releases for these
        languages. Other languages may be added later. We’re now making the final preparations to
        launch our own translated D&D products for the first time.

        To make D&D as successful in other languages as it is in English, we’re making a significant,
        long-term investment. Steps we’re taking include:</p>

    <h2>Chris Pratt, Anya Taylor-Joy And Seth Rogen Among The Cast For Illumination's Super Mario Brothers Movie</h2>
    <p>In the pantheon of video game adaptations, 1993's live-action Super Mario Brothers starring Bob
        Hoskins, John Leguizamo and Dennis Hopper certainly sits among the lower tiers. Since then,
        rights owners and game behemoth Nintendo has been reticent about letting studios adapt its
        characters, a stance that appeared to soften in 2017 when animation company Illumination struck
        a deal for an animated adventure featuring Mario, Luigi and the gang. The company has announced
        the voice cast, led by Chris Pratt, Anya Taylor-Joy, Charlie Day, Seth Rogen, Jack Black and
        Keegan-Michael Key.</p>
